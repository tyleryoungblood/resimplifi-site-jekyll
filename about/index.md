        <h1>How is REsimplifi different?</h1>
        <h3>As former agents we knew what wasn't working so ....</h3>

        <p>We spent countless hours with other agents developing an intuitive and easy to use application. We found that we could best serve the Commercial Real Estate community by lessening the administrative burden on agents by first reducing the amount of paper and the manual entry required to complete a transaction.</p>

        <p>At our core is this idea of automating your transaction process. REsimplifi is the industry's first process, transaction, and document management system. <em>We are not a CRM.</em> We start and end with documents. Your documents. We start with the processes that you already have in place. We take the documents that you already use and build a path to success based upon how you run your business. Things like contact and property details are by-products of our application capturing the detail necessary to complete your transaction documents. You enter your information one time and we take care of all the documents you need to support your client in selling or leasing their property.</p>

        <p>Effective agents do not need complicated tools designed for the desk employees of a traditional industry. At REsimplifi we understand our business is different. We take a fresh approach to the transaction management process. Our product is designed to be elegantly simple. We help you spend less time at your desk and more time closing business.</p>
